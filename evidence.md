# Evidence of 1b and 1c
In this document I will upload screenshots that show that I executed steps 1b and 1c. This repository was created for question 1a, so I believe that is evidence enough :).

Here is a screenshot of me adding Giulia as my collaborator (well I added her before taking the screenshot but this is just after that).

You can see that I cloned Giulia's repos to my local desktop.

I am also very annoying so I created an Issue on Giulia's code. I assigned her to the issue and labeled the it.

I created two Pull-Request for Giulia's page:

I also received an Issue from Giulia, fixed it, and closed the Issue. I then pulled it from my GitHub Desktop.

Since I am very annoying, I also commented on one commit!

I don't understand very well what does ''Ensure you can run their code without any modifications''. If you are watching this part is because I was able to upload all the files. Is that what the problem set aimed for?

Also, for exercise 1c I modified the README.md file from Giulia's repo. Here I attach the evidence.
