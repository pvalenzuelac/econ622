# ECON622
In this repository I will upload all the stuff made for [ECON622](https://github.com/ubcecon/ECON622_2020). This course is a graduate level introduction to Julia. The full list of problem sets can be found [here](https://github.com/ubcecon/ECON622_2020/blob/master/problemsets.md). Probably all archives are full of mistakes. If you are interested in learning more about Julia you should visit [Quant Econ lectures](https://julia.quantecon.org).

This repository was created for the Problem Set 4 of the course. This problem sets follows the [Version Control](https://julia.quantecon.org/more_julia/version_control.html) module of Quantitative Economics with Julia. More specifically, Exercises 1a, 1b, and 1c. The code of my previous assignments are in the Problem Sets folder. 

Evidence that I executed the steps 1b and 1b can be found [here](evidence.md)
