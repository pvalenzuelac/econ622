# ECON622
In this repository I will upload all the stuff made for [ECON622](https://github.com/ubcecon/ECON622_2020). This course is a graduate level introduction to Julia. The full list of problem sets can be found [here](https://github.com/ubcecon/ECON622_2020/blob/master/problemsets.md). Probably all archives are full of mistakes.
If you are interested in learning more about Julia you should visit [Quant Econ lecures](https://julia.quantecon.org).
